# Information about employee network

The `documents` folder contains all the files released by the Environment Agency in response to an FOI request by a member of the public:

The files are no longer available at whatdotheyknow.com because the download link has expired. Here we make them publicly available again. You can view them individually in your 
browser or download the whole set as a zip.
